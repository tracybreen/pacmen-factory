# pacmen-factory

This program utilizes JavaScript and HTML to allow the user to fill a screen with little PacMen, bouncing around at various speeds.

## How to Run

Load the index.html file in your browser and click the "Add PacMan" button to produce a Pacman at a random location near the top left corner of the screen. You can press it as many times as you like to add more little yellow dudes to the party. Pressing "Start Game" will set your frozen Pacmen free; they'll all begin bouncing around the screen at whatever random speed they choose.

For even more excitement, add a few more Pacmen to the mix when the party's already jumping, and hit that Start button again. Wheee! Everything is getting even zoomier!

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Add function to open and close mouth

Add face direction change on richochet
